# FMS Acceleration for Fused Operations and Kernels

This library contains fused operations and custom kernels, to be expanded over time. Currently it contains the following:


1. Fused operations and kernels extracted from [unsloth](#extracted-code-from-unsloth). 
    - Low-Rank Adapter Fused Operations
    - Fast RoPE Triton Kernels
    - Fast RMS LayerNorm Triton Kernels
    - Fast Cross Entropy Triton Kernels

## Plugins

Plugin | Description | Depends | Loading | Augmentation | Callbacks

[fast_quantized_peft](./src/fms_accelerate_foak/framework_plugin_fast_quantized_peft.py) | LoRA fused ops, fast cross-entropy, fast rms, fast RoPE | Contains extracted code |  | ✅
[fast_kernels](./src/fms_accelerate_foak/framework_plugin_fast_kernels.py) | Enhanced version of quantized_peft, that also works for full-FT and non-quant peft | Contains extracted code |  | ✅


### Code Extracted from Unsloth


Notes on the extraction of code from [unsloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth):
- While unsloth is [released under Apache 2.0](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/blob/main/LICENSE), there are comments indicating some exceptions strewn throughout the code base, see [an example here](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/blob/ec19e61c854dcf9104386fa63fc6c4f2944d4f35/unsloth/models/llama.py#L1140-L1143).
    ```
    it would require a commercial license if used to run on more than 4 GPUs ...
    ```
- These exceptions appear to be located around the trainer improvements, see [another example here](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/blob/ec19e61c854dcf9104386fa63fc6c4f2944d4f35/unsloth/models/llama.py#L1177-L1183).
- These exceptions appear around [Feb 2024 Release](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/commit/3e4c5a323c16bbda2c92212b790073c4e99c2a55); any code that appears in any file where such exceptions occur **is not extracted**.
- Instead in its place, we have adopted a different approach; we adopt the approach of model patching, as opposed unsloths' approach to rewrite the model. Our approach is novel and **completely rewritten from scratch**. 
- We have also enabled dropout on the lora fused operations.
- All extracted code appears before the Feb 2024 Release. 
- In the table below we record what was extracted, and the exact commit from which it was taken.

## Code Extracted from Liger
- TODO

## Known Issues

- MixedPrecision `--fp16` should be used `fast_lora`. Also consider loading the model in `torch.float16`.
- `fast_lora` has issues with FSDP with the `peft` style of FSDP wrapping. 
    * This is because the adapter's forward functions are bypassed in the fused ops.
    * For AutoGPTQ this is addressed by distributing the adapters using DDP so they will be unsharded in time for the fused ops.
    * However for QLoRA this is not yet done https://github.com/foundation-model-stack/fms-acceleration/issues/3.
- `fast_rope_embeddings` does not work with position_ids. Currently `position_ids` are ignored and could give wrong results.
