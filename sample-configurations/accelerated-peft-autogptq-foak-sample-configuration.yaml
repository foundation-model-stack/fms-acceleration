# FMS Acceleration Plugin Configuration. 
#
# Each stanza incorporates various configurations for 
# different fine-tuning / training tasks.
plugins:
    # PEFT-related acceleration
  peft:

      # quantization-releated acceleration
      # e.g., kernels for quantized base weights
    quantization:

        # AutoGPTQ quantized base weights.
      auto_gptq:

          # Kernel to be used for GPTQ linear laeyer
          # NOTE: Not all kernels are suitable for PEFT training; need to use 
          # kernels that support autograd forward / backward. The best 
          # recommendation at the moment is "triton_v2".
        kernel: triton_v2

          # If true, then will already expect quantized checkpoint 
          # passed into TrainingArguments.model_name_or_path
        from_quantized: true
      fused_ops_and_kernels:

        # load unsloth optimizations for these 4bit base layer weights.
        # currently only support "auto_gptq" and "bitsandbytes"
        base_layer: auto_gptq

        # activate various unsloth optimizations
        # NOTE: currently supports only all-or-nothing.

        # fused kernels for lora linear layers
        fused_lora: true

        # fast loss triton kernels
        fast_loss: true

        # fast rms norm triton kernels
        fast_rsm_layernorm: true

        # fast RoPE embedding triton kernels
        fast_rope_embeddings: true
